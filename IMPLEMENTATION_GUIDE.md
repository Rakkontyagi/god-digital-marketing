## 🎨 CONTENT CREATION BEST PRACTICES

### Writing Quality Standards:

**1. Sentence Variety (CRITICAL for AI Detection Avoidance):**
- Short (5-8 words): "Results matter. Rankings don't pay bills."
- Medium (12-20 words): "We've helped over 150 Mumbai businesses grow through strategic, data-driven SEO that delivers measurable results."
- Long (25-35 words): "When someone in Bandra searches for Italian restaurants near them, they're not looking for options across Mumbai—they want recommendations within walking distance, with current menus, and recent reviews from people they trust."
- **Mix ratios:** 20% short, 50% medium, 30% long

**2. Paragraph Structure:**
- Vary between 1-5 sentences
- Never more than 3 paragraphs in a row of same length
- Use one-sentence paragraphs for emphasis: "That's why SEO matters."

**3. Transition Phrases (Use Different Ones):**
- Addition: Moreover, Additionally, Beyond that, What's more, On top of this
- Contrast: However, Yet, That said, Conversely, On the other hand
- Example: For instance, Consider, Take, Think about, Look at
- Result: Therefore, As a result, This means, Consequently
- Emphasis: Indeed, In fact, Notably, Crucially, Importantly

**4. Personal Touch Elements:**
- "In our experience..."
- "We've found that..."
- "Here's what we've learned:"
- "The reality is..."
- "Let's be honest—"
- "Here's the truth:"

**5. Specific Over Generic:**
- ❌ "We provide excellent service"
- ✅ "Our average client sees 3.2x traffic increase within 6 months"

- ❌ "We have experienced team"
- ✅ "Our SEO specialists have 8+ years average experience and manage ₹5+ crore in client SEO budgets annually"

**6. Industry-Specific Language:**
Each industry has unique terminology. Use it naturally:
- Healthcare: Patients, appointments, specialists, E-A-T, YMYL
- Real Estate: Properties, listings, brokers, neighborhoods, RERA
- E-commerce: Conversions, cart abandonment, product feeds, SKUs
- Legal: Practice areas, cases, clients, bar association

---

## 🔗 INTERNAL LINKING STRATEGY

### Silo Structure Rules:

**From Homepage:**
- Link to main service pages (all 8 services)
- Link to top 5 location pages
- Link to About, Contact
- Do NOT link to every city (too many links)

**From Main Service Page (e.g., SEO Services):**
- Link UP to Services overview
- Link DOWN to:
  - Top 10 city pages
  - Top 5 state pages
  - Top 8 industry pages
- Link SIDEWAYS to 2-3 related services

**From City Page (e.g., Mumbai SEO):**
- Link UP to:
  - State page (Maharashtra)
  - Main service page (SEO Services)
  - Services overview
- Link DOWN to:
  - 5-10 sector/area pages
- Link SIDEWAYS to:
  - 2-3 nearby cities
  - 2-3 relevant industries

**From Industry Page (e.g., Healthcare SEO):**
- Link UP to main service page
- Link DOWN to industry+city combos (if created)
- Link SIDEWAYS to related industries

### Anchor Text Variations:

**For same link, rotate between:**
1. Exact: "SEO services in Mumbai"
2. Partial: "our Mumbai SEO services"
3. LSI: "search optimization in Mumbai"
4. Natural: "businesses in Mumbai benefit from SEO"
5. Branded: "God Digital Marketing's Mumbai SEO"
6. Long-tail: "professional SEO services for Mumbai businesses"

**NEVER use same anchor text twice for same link across the site.**
